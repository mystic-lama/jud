# JUD - Just Another Database

## Why JUD?

Always wanted to know details about internals of Databases. 
JUD is an effort to implement those learning in spare time.

JUD shall be a reflection of my journey in writing a simple working database.

### Why not participate in existing Database projects?

Shall try to do the same, however sometime creating something simple is exciting.

### Any timelines

Currently, no, since most of the work shall be done in personal time,
this shall be a slow process.

### Will JUD ever go live?

There are no plans around making it GA. It shall most likely be a learning project only.
